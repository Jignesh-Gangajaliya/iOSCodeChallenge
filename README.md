## The Challenge
Develop a **Swift** App, to download, save, and display contents of a list.

*Expected behavior:*

Upon launching the app, it should query this  [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AxxessTech/Mobile-Projects/master/challenge.json) , which will provide you the necessary content to populate the app in the JSON format.
**Programmatically (no storyboards)** create the user interface that allows the user to:
 
1. see all JSON fields in a clean and concise format
2. sort and display items based on their “type”
3. select an item to see it full screen.
4. store data in device, and to view while offline

*Bonus*
You don't necessarily need to do the following, but will be an add on to your project.
- Using [Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa) for local storage
- Unit Testing / UI Testing
- Universal interface support (iPhone & iPad)
